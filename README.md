# Rust on Arm Cortex-R and Cortex-A

This repository provides support for:

* Armv7-R Processors, like the Arm Cortex-R5
* Armv8-R AArch32 Processors, like the Arm Cortex-R52
* Armv7-A Processors, like the Arm Cortex-A5
* Armv8-A AArch32 Processors, like the Arm Cortex-A53 running in 32-bit mode

These libraries were originally written by Ferrous Systems, and are based on the
[`cortex-m` libraries] from the [Rust Embedded Devices Working Group].

[`cortex-m` libraries]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m
[Rust Embedded Devices Working Group]: https://github.com/rust-embedded

There are currently three libraries here:

* [cortex-ar](./cortex-ar/) - support library for Cortex-R and Cortex-A CPUs (like [cortex-m])
* [cortex-r-rt](./cortex-r-rt/) - run-time library for Cortex-R CPUs (like [cortex-m-rt])
* [cortex-a-rt](./cortex-a-rt/) - run-time library for Cortex-A CPUs (like [cortex-m-rt])
* [arm-targets](./arm-targets/) - a helper library for your build.rs that sets various `--cfg` flags according to the current target

There are also example programs for QEMU in the [examples](./-examples/) folder.
